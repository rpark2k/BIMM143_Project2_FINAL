# BIMM143_Project2_FINAL

This is the FINAL draft of project 2D.

Scientific Question: The protein Tau has several isoforms, how do they differ by their protein sequences using a BLAST search and pairwise sequence alignment?

Scientific Hypothesis: If all protein tau isoforms are causes of Alzheimer's disease, then comparing the sequence of an isoform with another through a BLAST search will result in several different regions of similarity.
